This was a fun challenge to make a game in a week, and the theme was also pretty interesting too: Bubbles.

We made this in a small team and i was in charge of the programming. One of the challenges i overcame was impleneting dialogue, as i'd never done it before. the way i ended up doing it (using functions and passing a string) is probably not the best way, as an external file may have been more expandable, however i am pleased with how it turned out.
